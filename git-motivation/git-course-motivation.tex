\section{Introduction}

\frame{\frametitle{Motivation}
  \bi
    \item We are working far more collaboratively than in the past -- sharing code and writing documents.
    \item Stock assessments, for example, can be extremely complex with Bayesian output (recent Pacific Ocean Perch assessment had $>200$ figures in just one Appendix).
    \item How to share code and make sure we are working on the same version?
    \item Emailing versions of files back and forth is:
    \bi 
      \item very inefficient,
      \item prone to errors,
      \item painful.
    \ei
    \item With complex code we need to have {\red identical} folder structures on each other's computers. 
  \ei

  Often we may be collaborating on a project but be busy on something else, yet our collaborator has time.

\frame{\frametitle{Can easily catch up with collaborator}

  Chris did a lot of work (`commits') from 11th May ...

  I did nothing in that time ...

\frame{\frametitle{Can easily catch up with collaborator}

  ... but just needed three commands (that you'll learn) to get caught up:

  All files that Chris edited got updated, plus I now have any new files he created, and our folder structures are identical.

  Rather than go to the code on my laptop that I haven't looked at for six months, I could click on link and answer very quickly.

  I hadn't thought of that before [on \gh: Code -- $<$click file$>$ -- History].

\frame{\frametitle{Pacific Hake assessment}

  \bi 
    \item Collaboration between four/five US and Canadian scientists.
    \item Annual assessment.
    \item Full Bayesian statistical catch-at-age model (complex output).
    \item Short turnaround between getting final data and submitting assessment.
    \item Short turnaround between review meeting and publishing assessment (two days).
    \item 2015 and before -- lots of editing and amalgamating Word files late at night. 
  \ei
}

\frame{\frametitle{Pacific Hake assessment}
  \bi
    \item After running models we can now automatically generate full document, including all numbers, figures and tables (via knitr and latex, all shared on \gh).

    \item Was a lot of work in 2016 to set up, but 2017 was way less stressful and resulted in more polished document.
    \item Praise on Twitter from one of the reviewers!

\frame{\frametitle{Groundfish data synopsis}
  \bi
  \item ``A reproducible data synopsis for over 100 species of British Columbia
    groundfish'' (Anderson, Keppel \& Edwards, submitted)
  \item Report generation fully automated:
    \bi
    \item pull data from databases
    \item fit models
    \item generate plots
    \item stitch together document
      \ei
    \item Facilitates annual publication, reproducibility, and transparency
    \item Goals:
      \bi
      \item enable regular review by groundfish scientists and managers of
        trends in survey indices
      \item generate standardized datasets and visualizations for a planned
        data-limited approach
      \item increase data transparency between Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the
        fishing industry, non-governmental organizations, and the public.

\frame{\frametitle{Can properly keep track of (and discuss) issues}

Rather than lots of emails that get forgotten, the to-do list actually gets completed.

\frame{\frametitle{Feedback from 2017 course}

% Hey, you two!

Wanted to send you a belated thank-you and update that using git

\bi
\item is now permanently part of my workflow

\item has vastly improved the organization \& communication for a few collaborative
projects I'm working on (making full use of ``issues'' and ``projects''
features).
\ei

It's also had a ripple effect on the Pacific salmon world, since my excitement over the git course was the proverbial straw that got Gottfried Pestal going full tilt into git \& now it looks like all of his projects and associated DFO staff are there, too. And I just saw first signs that some of the Pacific Salmon Commission staff are starting to use it too.

Now we (Gottfried \& I) are venturing into the world of {\tt .Rmd}, {\tt
  Pandoc}, etc. and I'm going back to your course materials to get myself re-oriented.

Thanks again!

\section{Summary}

\frame{\frametitle{Summary}

  \bi
    \item Ideal for sharing of code.
    \item `Repositories' can be public or private.
    \item Caveat -- cannot (properly) collaborate on Word files. We will concentrate at first on just sharing code. 
    \item We will use RMarkdown (easy) to generate a .pdf that complies with the
      CSAS style rules. Can also use to generate Word files. So you don't have
      to know \LaTeX.
    \item Hake, data synopsis and other examples show how far you can get.
    \item There \emph{is} a learning curve, but once you use \gh\ you only really need a few main commands.
