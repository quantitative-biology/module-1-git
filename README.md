# module-1-git
Introduction to Git and GitHub 

***Under development***

## Background

This is module 1 of five standalone modules that form a "Learner-centered quantitative education for biology graduate students". See https://github.com/quantitative-biology/course-overview for further details.

This module deals with **Transparent Research**, and will introduce students to collaborating and sharing computer code using the versioning tool Git and the public website GitHub.com. Adopting this workflow has many benefits, including creating a transparent record of research. (TODO: maybe more motivation from the proposal on the main overview site, or duplicate a bit here??). 

The target audience is graduate students in biology, plus others working in universities and government agencies, who may not have a strong computer studies background. Such a workflow is being increasingly used in the workplace.

  
## Outline

The module is self contained and will be a mixture of online video demonstrations and exercises. All slides are made available for the online videos. 

|Component    |Type      |Approximate duration    |
|-------------|----------|------------------------|
|Motivation for using Git and GitHub | Video   | ?? min   |
|Setting up Git and GitHub           | Video   | Who knows! |
|Demonstration of basic use          | Video | ?? min  |
|Exercise 1 - your first commits     |User exercise based on slides | ?? | 
|Demonstration of simple collaboration | Video (Andy and Kim recording two screens, hopefully)  | ?? | 
|Exercise 2 - collaboration          | User exercise with a colleague (can be skipped if necessary) | ?? |


Notes to self: 

- add in 'what is git' slide from very first course if it's not in TTT ones.



We are using a git shell to type in commands, for a number of reasons, mainly:

- commands are the same for Windows, Linux and MacOS
- it is instructive to learn the few basic commands (especially if you need to Google something one day)
- there are GUIs available but it easier to learn from copying commands than watching someone clicking buttons
