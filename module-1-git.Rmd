# Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Motivation

As a biology graduate student or a professional biologist in a university or
government setting, why might you want to use Git and GitHub? And what are Git
and GitHub anyway?

* Scientists (including students) are working far more collaboratively than in the past
* This involves both sharing code and writing up results
* There is a push towards open science -- including your code as part of a scientific paper
* We have called this a TTT approach:
  + Transparent -- a clear and open way to show data, code, and results, enabling reproducibility
  + Traceable -- a clear link from database queries and code to final results (numbers, tables, and graphs in a document)
  + Transferable -- it should be feasible for another person to reproduce work and build upon it with a minimal learning curve

Using Git and GitHub in your workflow greatly enables this, both when working alone and in a team.

* `r colorize("Git")` keeps track of the latest versions of your files,
    such as computer code or write up for results as you work on them.
* It also allows you to go back to `r colorize("any previous version")` of your
    files (this is 'version control'). (It also does much more).
* `r colorize("GitHub")` is a website that hosts a 'repository' of your work code and enables
      users to easily collaborate.
* Your repositories can be either public or private.

We use Git and GitHub extensively:

 * to collaborate on writing code and producing documents (such as this entire document!).
 * to easily share code publically for scientific  papers, and update it if necessary.
 * when working alone to retain a methodical workflow.

**Example application -- Pacific Hake stock assessment**

Under a formal Agreement between the Canadian and US governments, a team of four
of us (two from each country) conduct an
annual stock assessment for Pacific Hake (_Merluccius productus_) off the west
coast of Canada and the US. The assessment is used to manage the stock, which is of important
ecological and economic value ($100 million export value in Canada).

![](../module-1-git/images/hake-picture.png){width=50%}

We fit complex population models to data to make projections about future
health of the stock under different levels of catch. There is a very short
turnaround (five weeks) between getting the final data, doing the analyses
(model runs can take many hours of computer time) and submitting the
assessment document, which is typically >200 pages and contains numerous figures
and tables [available
here](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/2021-03/hake-assessment-post-srg-final_20210303.pdf?null).

Prior to 2016, the document was assembled in Word, requiring lots of editing
and amaglamating of files, often late at night. Now we share our code via
GitHub, automate a lot of the document production using knitr (similar to
Rmarkdown, covered in Module 2).

So with four people constantly working on the same large document, we need to
ensure we are keeping up-to-date with each other, can all produce the latest
version, and have `r colorize("identical")` folder structures on each other's
computers. The alternative of emailing files back and forth is:

* very inefficient,
* prone to errors,
* just painful.

**What we can avoid**

Using GitHub it is easy to see what text/code collaborators have changed, avoiding
things like the following, for which it hard to see where to get started:

![](../module-1-git/images/interim.png){width=100%}


We may want to keep old versions of files (and email them back and forth), but
without GitHub we can end up with a veritable gong show:

![](../module-1-git/images/EAversions.png){width=100%}

We can avoid having to co-ordinate having only one person working on the latest
version of a document, so we don't get things like:

![](../module-1-git/images/proposalEmail.png){width=100%}

Can avoid multiple versions of a file that then have to be carefully merged:

![](../module-1-git/images/dogsBreakfast.png){width=100%}

While GoogleDocs, for example, is fine for collaborating on a short document, it
isn't suitable for sharing complex code, or complex documents that are somewhat
automatically updated.

**GitHub advantages**

1. Say you've off on a two-week hike while your collaborators
have been diligently working away and they have edited 15 new files of code in
five folders, added four data sets, and created five new pages of text towards
a manuscript. You can easily
catch up with them (get all their changes onto your computer) with a few
simple commands. You don't even have to pester them to ask what they've done,
as you can check it yourself.

So rather than this conversation:

* You: "Hey, I'm back from my awesome trip and saw some bears. What have you
  been doing with the project?"

* Likely reply: "Glad you had fun. I'm busy on something else right now. Er,
  where were we at when you left?"

You can have this one:

* You: "Hey, I'm back from my awesome trip and saw some bears. I went through your
    commits on GitHub and everything looks great. Shall I get on those Methods
    Issues you assigned me?"

* Likely reply: "Glad you had fun, looking forward to hearing about it. I'm busy
  on something else right now so, yes, resolving those issues will be great,
  thanks."

And the project keeps moving in an efficient way.


2. By having code shared publically, it is easy to answer questions, such as
   this one I received:

![](../module-1-git/images/MEEcodeQuest.png){width=100%}

Rather than go searching on my laptop for the code that I hadn't looked at for
six months, I could click on the link the questioner sent and answer very
quickly, with a simple link to the file I am referring to (there is no ambiguity):

![](../module-1-git/images/MEEcodeAnswer.png){width=100%}


3. You can even ask who last edited a particular line of code/text (GitHub
  amusingly calls it 'Blame'):

![](../module-1-git/images/blame.png){width=100%}

4. You can properly keep track of (and discuss) 'Issues' to be thought about or
  fixed, rather than having things in emails that get forgotten:

![](../module-1-git/images/hakeIssues21.png){width=100%}

5. **Important:** You still have all your work locally on your computer. So if
  your internet access goes down or GitHub is unavailable (which of course will only happen
  when you have a deadline) you can still carry on with your work.


**Why this course?**

Delving into the Git and GitHub world online it can feel like you need a
computer science degree to get started. This may not be surprising as Git
was writting by the guy who wrote the operating system Linux, to help people
collaborate on writing the operating system Linux. But it means that, for
example, the second paragraph of the Wikipedia Git page says:

"As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most
client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged
repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities,
independent of network access or a central server."

Say what??? That is fairly incomprehensible to those without strong computer science
backgrounds. The aim of this module is to introduce biologists to the world of
Git and GitHub, while avoiding a lot of the technical details. However, once you
have mastered the basics then it should be easier to delve deeper.

Our target audience is:

* graduate level biology students
* biology faculty
* government scientists
* scientists in non-governmental organisations
* in fact anyone wanting to learn these tools

This work is extended from lectures and exercises developed by Chris Grandin and
myself as part of a
[Fisheries and Oceans Canada workshop](https://github.com/pbs-assess/TTTworkshop). (Luckily Chris
_does_ have a computer science degree, and so was able to get some of us going
with Git and GitHub several years ago). These tools are now widely used within
our organisation.

**Computer language**

For sharing code, it doesn't matter what language your code is in (R, Matlab, Python, C,
...), as we will just be sharing text files. There is a learning curve, but once
you get going you only really need a few main commands. Unfortunately the hardest bit is
actually getting everything set up....

## Getting set up for the first time

Before you start using Git you need to set up your computer to use it, and install a few other programs that are useful.

This is a `r colorize("one-time setup")`
and once it is done, you
will be able to easily create new projects or join others in collaboration.

We have tested the installations as much as feasible. If you have an issue then search the internet, as it may be due to some configuration on your particular computer.

This module is for any operating system: Windows, MacOS, Linux or Unix.

### What you will end up having installed
These are programs/things you will need (instructions are on the next slides). Obviously skip any that you already have working.

* A GitHub account
* A text editor that isn't Notepad
* Git on your computer
* Diffmerge or something similar for comparing changes to files (not completely necessary)
* Markdown Pad 2 or Chrome extension or something similar for viewing Markdown files (not completely necessary)

### Get a GitHub account
* Sign up for GitHub: http://github.com
* If possible, choose a user name that will make sense to colleagues, e.g. __andrew-edwards__ or __cgrandin__, not __pink-unicorn__.
* Desirable: attach a photo (headshot) to your profile. This makes it easy for collaborators to identify you.

### Text Editor
You must have a text editor that is aware of outside changes in a file. This is necessary because if you have a file open in the editor and you download an updated version of the file, you want the editor to ask you if you want to use the updated version.

We know that __Emacs__, __Xemacs__ and maybe __Vim__ are okay, as is __RStudiofor.R__ (and other) files.

__Notepad__ is not okay. But you can download and install __Notepad++__ which is fine:

https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.3.3.html

### Install the Git application on your machine
See https://git-scm.com/downloads for downloading instructions for Windows, MAC and Linux/Unix

It seems best to accept the default options, except NOT Notepad or Vim (unless
you use Vim) as the default editor.

### Git shell
For this course we will use a simple git shell to type commands (rather than a point-and-click Graphical User Interface). This is for several reasons:

1. Commands are the same across operating systems.
2. It is easier to demonstrate (and remember) a few simple commands, rather than follow a cursor moving across a screen.
3. Learning the text commands will give you a good understanding of how Git and GitHub work.
4. It is easier to Google for help when you get stuck or want to learn about more advanced options.

### Git shell, RStudio
There are many Graphical User Interfaces that are available, as described at https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis.

Many (but not all) biologists use R in RStudio for their analyses. There is Git functionality built in to RStudio that we (TODO: SOMEONE?) will demonstrate later.

I use magit which works in the text editor emacs (which for years I have used
for pretty much everything, such as editing files, running R, Matlab, etc.). But
I would not have been able to learn magit without first knowing the Git commands
from using the shell.

For now we will stick with the Git shell for the aforementioned reasons. It will
also give you a better understanding of Git and GitHub, and emphasise that you
can use Git for any files, not just R code.

### Powershell and posh-git
Download a Powershell (a shell window in which you can type commands, presumably
the ‘power’ part means it’s more powerful than a basic version) and then
posh-git following the instructions at https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git

Do the ‘Installation’ and ‘Using posh-git’ sections.  If you don’t understand
some options (I don’t!) just pick the simplest, usually the first.

The next slides are from our course about three years ago (and were for
Windows). So they may be out of date (though first one is recent tips from a colleague).

[Maybe we should see https://upg-dh.newtfire.org/explainGitShell.html]

### One-time authentication
The first time you get set up or start using Git, there will be some one-timeauthentication to connect to your GitHub account. Follow any instructions.

### Configure the Git application
* Windows
  1. Create a github directory, such as C:\github.  It is fine to put it in a differentpath, but make sure there are no spaces or special charactersanywherein the fullpath. This is where you want to be saving your work that you are tracking with Git.
  2. TODO: Andy has to reinstall anyway and will write something here. Think it’s just following instructions.
<br>
* MAC
  1. Create the directory ~/github
  2. Enjoy a beverage
  3. TODO: Check with Luwen if it is that simple

### "Cloning" the git-course repository
For these instructions, replace GITHUB-USER with your GitHub account name.

* On the GitHub webpage, sign into your account and navigate to: https://github.com/quantitative-biology/module-1-git
* Windows: Open the Git shell and run the following command to clone the
repository ('clone' means copy all files in the repository to your computer):
```
git clone https://github.com/quantitative-biology/module-1-git
```
* MAC: Open terminal and change to the GitHub directory: cd ~/github then run
the clone command:
```
git clone https://github.com/quantitative-biology/module-1-git
```
* You now have the files for the GitHub course on your computer

### Copy the _.gitignore_ file
* Git uses a configuration file for your account info, name to use when committing, aliases for commands, and other things.
* Open up the _misc_ sub-directory in the git-module-1 directory and copy the file _.gitconfig_.
* For Windows, copy this file (overwrite the existing file) to: C:\Users\YOUR-COMPUTER-USER-NAME\.gitconfig, where YOUR-COMPUTER-USER-NAME is your username on your computer, not your GitHub account name.
* For MAC, copy this file (overwrite the existing file) to: ~/.gitconfig

### Edit the _.gitconfig_ file
* Use your favourite editor to edit the new file (not the one ingit-course/misc).
* Change the [user] settings to reflect your information.
* Change the [difftool] and [diffmerge] directories so they point to the location where you have DiffMerge.
* For Windows the location should be: C:\Program Files\SourceGear\Common\DiffMerge\sgdm.exe
* For MAC the location should be: /usr/local/bin/diffmerge
* If you could not install [difftool] or [diffmerge] then delete those lines in your _.gitconfig_ file.

### MAC only: make your output pretty
On the MAC, change the ~/github directory and run the following command:

git config --global color.ui.auto

This will make your git output colored in a similar way to the Windows powershell version.

### Install the difftool
The difftool will be used to examine differences between different versions of files andalso to simplify merging of branches and collaborator’s code. There are many programsthat can be used but for consistency we will use Diffmerge.

It is nice to have but not essential if you have trouble installing it.

Install Diffmerge: https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.php

The configuration for directing git to use Diffmerge will be done in a later step.

### Markdown Pad
Each project has an associated README.md file that appears on its GitHub homepage.The extension .md stands for Markdown and is just an ASCii text file that containssimple formatting (such as bold or italics). There are two options we have used to readmarkdown files, choose one:

* The Markdown Pad 2 editor/viewer which is easy to use: http://markdownpad.com. Just get the free version.
* The Chrome extension for markdown viewing: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=en.
